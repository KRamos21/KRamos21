## About me:
I've graduated from law school in 2015 and I have been working as a lawyer ever since. Nevertheless, technology is a field that has always aroused my curiosity and over time I've realized that it was more in line with my interests and aspirations. Thus, in early 2021, I decided to start a career transition and study programming harder.

Right now, I'm finishing a full-stack web development course at Digital House and taking programming classes at University.
